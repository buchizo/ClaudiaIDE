ClaudiaIDE
==========

This is a Visual Studio extension that lets you set a custom background image or slideshow.

## What's new

- Ver 3.0.3 Support tiled image in editor window.
- Ver 3.0.1 The ClaudiaIDE has been split into two Visual Studio versions, because the older version that needs to be resolved dependency of EnvDTE in Visual Studio 2022.
- Ver 3.0.0 support Visual Studio 2022 preview 1. However unfortunately drop off support for Visual Studio 2017. If you want support VS2017 ver, you can try use [ver 2.2.19](https://github.com/buchizo/ClaudiaIDE/releases/tag/Release2.2.19). Now mainstream is support Visual Studio 2019 and 2022 only.
- Ver 2.2.16 or later can support configuration per solution.

After save, this extension create .claudiaideconfig file in solution directory from current settings in option dialog. If you want to modify settings, you can modify this file (JSON format) or override via that menu.

#### Limitation

- Current feature of solution settings require restart Visual Studio after changed configfile.

## Version histories (summary)

### ver 2.2.x

Flickering has maybe been decreased, however the image fade interval option isn't supported for slideshows because problem effect by this update. If you want to expand the image to the full IDE window ("expand to IDE" option), ClaudiaIDE does not require theme editor. ClaudiaIDE automaticaly makes some backgrounds transparent (e.g. the text editor). However, for now, some windows, such as the solution explorer, still need to be made transaperent with theme editor, like as [Color Theme Editor for Visual Studio 2019](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioPlatformTeam.VisualStudio2019ColorThemeEditor).

Enabling the option "User hardware graphics acceleration if available" will reduce flickering.
